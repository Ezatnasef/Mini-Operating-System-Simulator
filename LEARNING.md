# Why C++? — Benefits, Features, and What This Project Teaches

This document explains why C++ was chosen for the AI422 RTOS Lab, which language features proved most useful, how threading and concurrency are used, and what you learn (both OS concepts and programming skills) by building or studying this project.

## 1. Why C++ for This Project (and Similar Systems/OS Projects)

### 1.1 Direct Mapping to OS Concepts

Operating systems courses describe **processes**, **threads**, **mutexes**, **semaphores**, and **schedulers**. In C++, you have first-class counterparts:

| OS concept        | C++ standard library              | How we use it in the simulator                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Thread           | `std::thread`                      | Module 3: real concurrent threads for sync demos  |
| Mutex            | `std::mutex`                       | Protecting shared buffer, logger, RAG state       |
| Condition var    | `std::condition_variable`          | Semaphore and “wait until resource” semantics     |
| Atomic operations| `std::atomic<T>`                   | Producer/consumer item counters without locks     |

Using the same primitives that real OSes expose (or wrap) makes the mental model consistent: what you simulate (e.g. “thread blocks on semaphore”) is what actually happens in the program. A language without native threads or mutexes would require a different, more abstract model and would teach concurrency less directly.

### 1.2 No Hidden Runtime or Garbage Collector

The simulator is a **single executable** with no interpreter or VM. There is no garbage collector, so:

- **Determinism:** When you run a scheduling or page-replacement algorithm, behavior is repeatable; no GC pauses.
- **Resource control:** You can reason about when memory is allocated and freed (e.g. virtual disk blocks, process lists). This aligns with OS topics like memory management and allocation policies.
- **Portability:** The same binary runs on any platform with a C++17 toolchain; no extra runtime to ship.

For projects that emulate kernels, schedulers, or allocators, this predictability and control are strong advantages.

### 1.3 Performance Where It Matters

We do not need maximum speed for a teaching simulator, but C++ still helps:

- **Concurrency (Module 3):** Real `std::thread`s run in parallel on multi-core machines. You can observe interleaving and timing without faking it.
- **No per-operation overhead:** Tight loops (e.g. Banker’s algorithm, page replacement, disk scheduling) run with minimal overhead, so even large inputs stay responsive.
- **Data layout:** Structs like `ProcessControlBlock` and `DirEntry` have predictable layout; useful when you later read about cache effects or when implementing something closer to a real kernel.

### 1.4 Rich Standard Library Without External Dependencies

The project uses **only the C++ standard library**:

- **Containers:** `std::vector`, `std::queue`, `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::list` for processes, ready queues, page frames, FAT, directory entries, and graph structures.
- **Algorithms:** `std::sort`, `std::min`, `std::max` for scheduling and replacement policies.
- **I/O:** `std::fstream` for the virtual disk (binary read/write).
- **Threading:** `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`, `std::lock_guard`, `std::atomic`.
- **Time:** `std::chrono` for timestamps and optional delays in demos.

So we get a full “systems programming” toolkit without depending on third-party libraries, which keeps the project portable and easy to build anywhere.

### 1.5 Suitability for Similar Projects

The same reasons apply to other educational or lightweight systems projects, for example:

- **CPU or disk scheduling simulators** — Same need for clear data structures, queues, and algorithms.
- **Concurrency demos** — Real threads and mutexes are essential.
- **Simple file systems or allocators** — Binary I/O, byte-level layout, and no GC match C++ well.
- **State machines (e.g. protocol or process life cycle)** — Enums and structs map directly to states and transitions.

For anything that is “close to the metal” or that teaches OS/architecture concepts, C++ is a natural fit.

## 2. C++ Features That Actually Help in This Project

Below are the language and library features that directly support the simulator’s design and clarity.

### 2.1 `enum class` for State

Process and thread states are represented as a **strongly typed enum**:

```cpp
enum class ProcessState { NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, TERMINATED };
```

- **Type safety:** You cannot accidentally mix with integers or other enums; transitions are explicit (e.g. `ProcessState::READY`).
- **Scoped names:** No global namespace pollution; the state set is clear and documented in one place.
- **Switch exhaustiveness:** Compilers can warn if you forget a case in `stateToString()` or in a scheduler.

This is used everywhere we deal with process/thread state (Module 1, 2, and when logging).

### 2.2 Structs and Value Semantics

Core data are **plain structs** with clear layout:

```cpp
struct ProcessControlBlock {
    int pid = 0;
    ProcessState state = ProcessState::NEW;
    int burst_time = 0;
    // ...
    std::vector<ThreadControlBlock> threads;
};
```

- **Default member initializers** (`= 0`, `= ProcessState::NEW`) avoid uninitialized bugs when creating new processes.
- **Value semantics:** Schedulers take `std::vector<ProcessControlBlock>` and can copy the vector to run the same workload with different algorithms without shared mutable state. That keeps “compare all algorithms” simple and safe.
- **Composability:** A PCB contains a `std::vector<ThreadControlBlock>`; the same idea (aggregate data + containers) is used for page tables, FAT, and directory entries.

### 2.3 STL Containers and Algorithms

- **`std::vector`:** Processes, threads, page frames, request queues, directory entries. Resizing and indexing are straightforward.
- **`std::queue`:** Ready queue in Round Robin and MLFQ; request queue in disk scheduling.
- **`std::map` / `std::set`:** Resource Allocation Graph (processes, resources, assignment/request edges); LRU structures in page replacement.
- **`std::sort`:** Ordering processes by arrival time (FCFS, RR) or by burst/priority (SJF, Priority).
- **`std::pair`:** Gantt chart entries `(pid, duration)` and similar ad-hoc pairs.

Using the standard library keeps the code short and readable and teaches you to rely on well-tested building blocks instead of hand-rolling every list or queue.

### 2.4 RAII and `std::lock_guard`

The logger is shared by multiple threads, so every log call must be serialized:

```cpp
void log(const std::string& tag, const std::string& msg) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(mtx_);
    // ... format and print ...
}
```

- **RAII:** The mutex is released automatically when `lk` goes out of scope, even on return or exception. No risk of forgetting to unlock.
- **`std::lock_guard`** is the standard way to “lock for the duration of this block.” The same pattern is used in the simulated mutex/semaphore wrappers so that every acquire has a matching release.

This directly supports the “synchronization primitives” theme of the project and models how real OS code uses critical sections.

### 2.5 Lambdas and Capture

In Module 3, each producer and consumer is a lambda passed to `std::thread`:

```cpp
auto producer = [&](int id) {
    std::string name = "Producer-" + std::to_string(id);
    while (true) {
        int item = produced.fetch_add(1);
        // ...
        empty.wait(name);
        bufMtx.lock(name);
        buffer.push_back(item);
        // ...
    }
};
std::thread t(producer, i + 1);
```

- **Closure by reference `[&]`:** The lambda sees the shared `buffer`, `bufMtx`, `empty`, `full`, and `produced`/`consumed`. That keeps the demo code compact.
- **By-value arguments `(int id)`:** Each thread gets its own id and builds its own `name` string, avoiding shared mutable string state.
- **Same pattern** is used for readers, writers, philosophers, and the barber thread. You get one clear template for “run this function in a thread with this id.”

### 2.6 `std::atomic` for Lock-Free Counters

Producer-Consumer uses atomics for the next item index and consumed count:

```cpp
std::atomic<int> produced{0};
std::atomic<int> consumed{0};
// ...
int item = produced.fetch_add(1);
int c = consumed.fetch_add(1);
```

- **No mutex on the counter:** Multiple threads can advance the counter without blocking each other, reducing contention.
- **Clear semantics:** `fetch_add` is exactly “read-modify-write atomically,” which matches the idea of a shared counter in concurrency theory.
- **Teaches a simple lock-free pattern** before diving into more complex lock-free structures.

### 2.7 Binary I/O and Layout Control

The virtual disk (Module 7) uses `std::fstream` with fixed block size and explicit offsets:

```cpp
void readBlock(int blockNum, void* buffer) {
    std::ifstream f(path_, std::ios::binary);
    f.seekg(blockNum * BLOCK_SIZE);
    f.read((char*)buffer, BLOCK_SIZE);
}
```

- **No hidden encoding:** Binary mode and `read`/`write` give precise control over bytes. Superblock, FAT, and directory entries are written with `memcpy` so layout matches the on-disk format.
- **Portability:** We rely on fixed-size types and explicit layout; no assumption about host endianness beyond what we document. This is how real file systems and OS metadata are often implemented.

So C++ here teaches “we control every byte” without leaving the standard library.

### 2.8 Singleton for Global Logger

The logger is a **thread-safe singleton**:

```cpp
static Logger& instance() {
    static Logger inst;
    return inst;
}
```

- **Single instance:** Any module can call `Logger::instance().log(...)` without passing a logger reference. The static local is initialized once (C++11 guarantees).
- **Encapsulation:** Construction and internal mutex are private; the rest of the code only uses the public interface. This is a common pattern in C++ for global services.

### 2.9 Header-Only or Small Translation Units

Much of the logic lives in **headers** (e.g. `scheduler.h`, `page_replacement.h`, `disk_scheduler.h`) as inline or template-heavy code. Benefits:

- **Simple build:** Few .cpp files, so the project compiles quickly and dependencies are obvious.
- **Inlining:** Small helpers (e.g. `stateToString`, metric computation) can be inlined, which is fine for a simulator where clarity matters more than compilation time.
- **Easier refactoring:** Moving a function between files is straightforward; you are not fighting a large number of translation units.

For a medium-sized teaching project, this keeps the structure understandable.

## 3. Thread Usage and Concurrency

### 3.1 Where Threads Are Used

**Module 3 (Synchronization Playground)** is the only part that creates multiple **real** OS threads:

- **Producer-Consumer:** Several producer threads and several consumer threads share a buffer, a mutex, and two semaphores (empty/full).
- **Readers-Writers:** Reader and writer threads share a “data” variable and use a shared mutex plus a “reader count” mutex and a single “rw” semaphore.
- **Dining Philosophers:** One thread per philosopher; each thread repeatedly thinks, acquires two fork semaphores (in a fixed order to avoid deadlock), eats, then releases them.
- **Sleeping Barber:** One barber thread and multiple customer threads; customers wait on a semaphore and a mutex for the waiting room.

In all cases we use:

- `std::thread` to run the logic.
- `std::mutex` (sometimes wrapped in our `SimMutex` for logging) to protect shared data.
- `std::condition_variable` (inside `SimSemaphore`) to block until a resource is available.
- `std::atomic` where we only need a shared counter.

### 3.2 What This Teaches About Concurrency

- **Critical sections:** Only one thread at a time updates the buffer (or the “data” in Readers-Writers). The mutex defines the critical section; the logs show “acquired”/“released” so you see when threads serialize.
- **Blocking vs busy-wait:** Semaphores use `condition_variable::wait()` so a thread blocks in the kernel instead of spinning. The logs show “waiting on Empty” / “passed Empty,” which matches “blocked” vs “running.”
- **Deadlock avoidance:** In Dining Philosophers, the order of locking (e.g. “smaller fork id first” or “last philosopher picks in reverse order”) is explicit so that no circular wait can form. You can compare with a broken order to see deadlock.
- **Starvation and fairness:** With many readers and writers, or many philosophers, you can observe that some threads may run less often; the timestamped log helps discuss fairness and scheduling.
- **Real parallelism:** On a multi-core machine, producer and consumer threads really run in parallel; interleaving is non-deterministic and varies from run to run, which is exactly what you want when teaching concurrency.

### 3.3 Thread-Safe Logger

The logger is used from multiple threads at once, so every `log(...)` call is protected by a mutex. That way:

- Lines do not interleave in the middle of a message.
- You see a single, consistent timeline of events (with timestamps) when analyzing a run.

So the project also demonstrates **how to share a single output stream safely** among threads, a recurring need in concurrent programs.

## 4. What Else the Project Teaches

Beyond “why C++” and “how we use threads,” the simulator is a vehicle for learning the following.

### 4.1 Operating Systems Concepts

- **Process and thread:** PCB/TCB, states (NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, TERMINATED), and transitions; difference between a process and a thread (shared address space, separate stacks).
- **Scheduling:** FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority, MLFQ; preemptive vs non-preemptive; metrics (waiting, turnaround, response, utilization, throughput); Gantt charts.
- **Synchronization:** Mutex, semaphore, condition variable; classic problems (Producer-Consumer, Readers-Writers, Dining Philosophers, Sleeping Barber); race conditions and critical sections.
- **Deadlock:** Resource Allocation Graph; cycle detection; Banker’s algorithm; safe/unsafe state; safe sequence.
- **Memory management:** Fixed vs variable partitioning; first/best/worst fit; internal and external fragmentation; compaction.
- **Virtual memory:** Logical vs physical address; page table; page fault; replacement policies (FIFO, LRU, Optimal, Clock); frame allocation.
- **File system:** Block device abstraction; superblock; FAT; directory entries; create/read/write/delete and directory operations.
- **I/O:** Request queue; disk scheduling (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN); seek time and total head movement.

### 4.2 Algorithms and Data Structures

- **Graphs:** RAG as a directed graph; DFS for cycle detection; adjacency representation (e.g. map from process to set of requested resources, and resource to holder).
- **Queues:** Ready queue (FCFS, RR, MLFQ), request queue (disk), and buffer (Producer-Consumer).
- **Tables and matrices:** Page table (page → frame), Allocation/Max/Need/Available in Banker’s, FAT (block → next block or EOF).
- **Sorting and selection:** Sort by arrival/burst/priority; “smallest burst” or “highest priority” selection in schedulers; “farthest use” in Optimal page replacement.
- **Simulation loops:** Time-step or event-step loops (e.g. “at each time unit, pick a process, run it, update state”) that mirror how discrete-event simulators work.

### 4.3 Software Design and C++ Practice

- **Modular structure:** One area per concern (process, scheduler, sync, deadlock, memory, vmem, filesystem, io); shared types in `common/`; clear include boundaries.
- **Interfaces by convention:** Schedulers all take a vector of PCBs and produce a result (e.g. Gantt + metrics); page replacement functions take reference string + frame count and return a result struct. No need for a formal base class here, but the pattern is clear.
- **Reuse:** Same `ProcessControlBlock` in Module 1 and 2; same display/logger across modules; same “compare all” idea in scheduling, page replacement, and disk scheduling.
- **Const correctness:** Const methods and const references where data is not modified (e.g. in RAG display and cycle detection).
- **Resource management:** RAII for mutexes; file streams opened and closed in a clear scope; no raw `new`/`delete` for core logic—containers and value types handle memory.
